# Login_Database_Registration
Project for image storage.

PHP: The main language of the project, responsible for handling server-side logic.
MySQL: The database used to store information about the images.
PDO (PHP Data Objects): I used PDO to establish a secure connection with the database and prevent security vulnerabilities.
HTML/CSS: Used for building the interface and styling the application.
JavaScript: Added some JavaScript to enhance the user experience, such as form validation and dynamic display of the image gallery.
